# Amen App Icon Preview

## Visual Description

When rendered, the Amen App icon appears as follows:

1. **Overall Shape**: A square with rounded corners (standard app icon format)

2. **Background**: A subtle white-to-light gray gradient that gives the icon a clean, modern feel

3. **Main Element**: A circle of 8 stylized human figures viewed from above:
   - Alternating colors of deep blue (#2B4C7E) and warm red (#D64045)
   - The figures are simplified and abstract, resembling people sitting in a circle
   - Their arrangement suggests community, discussion, and connection

4. **Center Element**: A subtle "A" shape in the negative space at the center:
   - Outlined with a thin blue stroke
   - Visually ties to the "Amen" name while maintaining minimalism
   - Creates a focal point without overwhelming the circular arrangement

## Visual Impact

The design is:
- **Modern**: Uses clean shapes and a contemporary color palette
- **Meaningful**: Directly reflects the community discussion aspect shown in the reference image
- **Memorable**: The circular arrangement creates a distinctive silhouette
