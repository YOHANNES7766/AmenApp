# Amen App Icon

This directory contains the app icon for Amen App in various formats and sizes.

## Design Concept

The Amen App icon is inspired by the community discussion format that is at the heart of the application. It features:

- A circular arrangement of stylized figures representing people gathered in discussion
- Clean, modern color palette with deep blue (#2B4C7E) and warm red (#D64045)
- Subtle "A" shape formed in the negative space at the center
- Minimalist design that works well at various sizes

## Files Included

- `assets/amen_app_icon.svg` - Vector source file (ideal for further modifications)
- `assets/png/` - Directory containing rasterized PNG versions at various sizes:
  - 512x512 (Play Store)
  - 192x192 (Android adaptive icon)
  - 180x180 (iOS)
  - 152x152 (iPad)
  - 144x144 (Android)
  - 120x120 (iPhone)
  - 76x76 (iOS settings)

## Usage Instructions

### For iOS:

1. Use the appropriate size icons from the `png` directory
2. Add them to your Xcode project's asset catalog
3. Configure in the app's Info.plist

### For Android:

1. Place the appropriate size icons in the respective `res/mipmap-*` directories
2. Configure in the app's manifest file

### For Web/Marketing:

The high-resolution PNG (512x512) or the SVG file can be used for marketing materials, website, and other promotional content.

## Design Rationale

The circular arrangement of figures symbolizes the community-focused nature of Amen App, where people gather to discuss, share, and learn together. The alternating colors represent diversity within the community, while the clean design ensures the icon is recognizable even at small sizes.
